### How to get your domain added to Ascella Uploader

### Step 1

Send a DM to tricked#3777 telling him what domain you want added. It should be a [Wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) domain

### Step 2

If you want a [Wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) domain added you are going to have to point your name server to Vercel. (tricked will send you the nameservers.)

If you just want a single subdomain or domain added, you're going to need to make a CNAME record to Vercel. (tricked will tell you the URL.)

### Step 3

After all of that, the Discord Bot will be updated to have your domain added to the domain list.

If you want it to be only used by you, that's fine. Just make sure to tell tricked.
