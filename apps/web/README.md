# Svelte frontend

Discord: https://discord.gg/mY8zTARu4g

This is the frontend for the Ascella uploader [https://ascella.host](https://ascella.host)

Its made using svelte making probably one of the fastest frontend's for a image uploader

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
