Ascella can be translated using the [crowdin](https://crwd.in/ascella-uploader) users who helped translating get a role in the discord!

Translations are currently only applied to the bot but theres plans to translate the Dashboard too!

### Alternatives

#### Via github

You can help translate by forking the [repo](https://github.com/Tricked-dev/ascella/blob/master/locales/) and then creating a new json file with [lang].json in the locales folder then just copy the en.json format.

#### Via discord

Edit the json file and dm tricked#3777 the new file on discord.
