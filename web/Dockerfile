### Build Step
# pull the Node.js Docker image
FROM node:16.2 as builder

# copy the package.json files from local machine to the workdir in container
COPY package*.json ./

# run npm install in our local machine
RUN npm ci

# copy the generated modules and all other files to the container
COPY . .

# build the application
RUN npm run build

### Serve Step
# pull the Node.js Docker image
FROM node:16.2.0-alpine3.13

# change working directory
WORKDIR /app

# copy files from previous step
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build .
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/package.json .
